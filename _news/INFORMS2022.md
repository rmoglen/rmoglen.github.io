I will be giving my presenation titled "[Restoration of Power Infrastructure Following a Nuclear Detonation](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10693/presentation/3403)" at [INFORMS 2022](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/indianapolis2022/).

_October 18, 2022, 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM in M - Marriott 7_

***Abstract:***
The restoration of infrastructure following a disaster, natural or man-made, is essential for the recovery of the critical services that infrastructure provides. The rarity of historical nuclear detonations limits observation-based mitigation strategies of their impacts on infrastructure. Characteristics of the destructive effects of nuclear detonations, such as lingering radioactive contamination, therefore present unique challenges in the restoration process that are not well studied. We address this gap by expanding the restoration modeling capabilities of the Toolbox for Interdependent Network Analysis (TINA), an existing framework for modelling nuclear detonation impacts on interdependent infrastructure.
