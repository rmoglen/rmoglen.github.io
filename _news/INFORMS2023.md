I will be giving my presenation titled "Restoration of Power Infrastructure Following a Nuclear Detonation" at [INFORMS 2023](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/phoenix2023/).

_October 18, 2022, 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM MST in CC-North 230_

***Abstract:***
After a disaster, the power grid helps support infrastructure systems that are essential to the recovery effort in addition to the critical services it provides every day. While many studies discuss optimal power grid restoration, they ignore coincident environmental hazards like debris, chemical hazards, or abnormal radioactivity that may constrain the restoration process. We formulate an optimal restoration planning framework with constraints imposed by acute and cumulative environmental hazards. In our analysis, we compare the performance of an optimal restoration strategy to a heuristic based on best practice restoration in the field. We apply our formulation to a case study of a nuclear event causing abnormal radioactivity.
