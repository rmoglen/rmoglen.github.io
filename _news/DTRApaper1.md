I'm excited to share my newest paper “Optimal Restoration of Power Infrastructure Following a Disaster with Environmental Hazards” that was recently published in [Socio-Economic Planning Sciences](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seps.2024.101974).
 
In this paper, we consider how hazardous environmental conditions, like flooding, smoke, debris, or chemical waste, can impact power grid restoration. We develop a framework to investigate how disaster characteristics, such as disaster magnitude and location, can impact the recovery process. We also demonstrate how our framework can be used to identify vulnerable regions of the network, which can be used to inform infrastructure resilience planning.
 
A big thank you to my collaborators: Benjamin Leibowicz, Alexis Kwasinski, and Grant Cruse!
