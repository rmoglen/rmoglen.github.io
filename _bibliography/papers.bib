    abstract = { The two Category-5 hurricanes that impacted the United States Virgin Islands in 2017 exposed critical infrastructure vulnerabilities that must be addressed. While the drinking water utility has first-hand knowledge about how the hurricanes affected their systems, the use of modeling and simulation tools can provide additional insight to aid investment planning and preparedness. This paper provides a case study on resilience analysis for the island’s potable water systems subject to long term power outages. Power outage scenarios help quantify differences in water delivery, water quality, and water quantity during and after the disruption. The analysis helps illustrate important differences in system operations and recovery time across the islands. Results from this case study can be used to better understand how the system might behave during future disruptions, provide justification for investment, and provide recommendations to increase resilience of the system. The analysis framework can also be used by other utilities to explore vulnerability to long term power outages. },

    abstract = { A proposed quantification of the fundamental concepts in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) rainfall-runoff relation is examined to determine changes relevant to peak discharge estimation and drainage design. Changes to the NRCS curve number, storage, and initial abstraction relations result in different estimates of the runoff volume, timing of runoff, and peak discharge produced by long-established empirical equations that quantify event-based runoff. The ratio of existing-to-proposed runoff depth estimates is determined across a range of curve numbers and storm depths. Similarly, the ratio of existing to proposed peak discharge is determined as a function of curve number, storm depth, and design storm within the NRCS TR-55 model. Using an infrastructure design based on the existing equations as the baseline, that infrastructure is underdesigned (overdesigned) if the proposed NRCS equations produce larger (smaller) estimates of volumes or discharges than the existing equations for the same watershed conditions. This study shows that the proposed NRCS equations more likely identify existing infrastructure as being underdesigned for smaller storm events and lower curve numbers. Conditions and design storm produce large variation in the design ratios. Storms with return periods on the order of 2–10\&nbsp;years generally result in peak discharge underdesign ratios that span from 1 to as high as 2 or 3 depending on the watershed conditions, storm size, curve number, and design element in question. Existing infrastructure overdesign is more likely the case when return periods approach 25, 50, or 100\&nbsp;years, with typical overdesign ratios ranging downward from 1.0 to as small as 0.8. In most cases, required storage volumes, as prescribed by the NRCS TR-55 approach, are found to be smaller using the proposed equations, leading to both cost savings and reduced pond residence times. Three common design problems are provided only to illustrate typical underdesign and overdesign findings. The central focus is on the potentially negative consequences of proposed changes to a limited aspect of curve number hydrology. },

    abstract = "{This paper develops means to analyze and cluster residential households into homogeneous groups based on the electricity load. Classifying customers by electricity load profiles is a top priority for retail electric providers (REPs), so they can plan and conduct demand response (DR) effectively. We present a practical method to identify the most DR-profitable customer groups as opposed to tailoring DR programs for each separate household, which may be computationally prohibitive. Electricity load data of 10,000 residential households from 2017 located in Texas was used. The study proposed the clustered load-profile method (CLPM) to classify residential customers based on their electricity load profiles in combination with a dynamic program for DR scheduling to optimize DR profits. The main conclusions are that the proposed approach has an average 2.3\\% profitability improvement over a business-as-usual heuristic. In addition, the proposed method on average is approximately 70 times faster than running the DR dynamic programming separately for each household. Thus, our method not only is an important application to provide computational business insights for REPs and other power market participants but also enhances resilience for power grid with an advanced DR scheduling tool.}",

  abstract = "{In the face of the considerable volatility in electricity market prices, retail electric providers (REPs) occupy the difficult position between the utility and the end-user. They purchase electricity either through long-term contracts, in the day-ahead or spot markets, or self-generate. This electricity is then sold to the end-user at a fixed price. Thus, REPs bear the financial burden of electricity price uncertainty. In a market where prices can increase by orders of magnitude in as little as 15 min, single spikes have driven some REPs to bankruptcy. To mitigate the negative effects of market volatility, REPs can employ demand response (DR), shifting consumers’ electricity load from periods of high prices to lower-priced time periods. While DR comes in many forms, we focus on thermostatically-controlled residential DR, made possible through internet-connected thermostats. The timing of residential heating and cooling load makes it a particularly financially advantageous target for DR. We present a dynamic programming (DP) formulation designed to optimally schedule DR events to maximize their savings for the REP. We also consider the effects of price uncertainty on the savings through the use of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). Our case study examines the profitability of thermostatically-controlled DR, specifically of air-conditioning (A/C) load, in the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). We find that optimal management of thermostatically-controlled DR can generate significant savings to the REP, potentially improving their profit margins as much as 25%. However, we also find that few events generate most savings, necessitating precise scheduling facilitated by our formulation. Electricity price uncertainty marginally reduces these expected savings, but optimally-scheduled DR still offers REPs an effective method of mitigating risk.}",
