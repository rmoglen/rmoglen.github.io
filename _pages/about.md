Hello world! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate studying operations research in the Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Program (ORIE)at the University of Texas at Austin. My current work explores the Food-Energy-Water nexus through the lens of disaster resilience and planning. I am an NSF NRT Fellow as part of the INFEWS scholars program. I serve on Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Board and am the current Secretary of UT Austin's INFORMS Student Chapter.


I earned an M.S. degree in operations research at the University of Maryland. My M.S. advisor was Dr. Steven Gabriel.  Our team, in collaboration with our corporate partner, Whisker Labs aimed to bring optimal demand-side management to the residential sector with the aid of internet-connected thermostats. My work focused on using dynamic programming to help Retail Electric Providers (REPs) with optimal demand response scheduling.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and most of all, making pottery. I love the squish of mud under my hands, the excitment guiding it into wares of all shapes and sizes. And of course, it's always fun to get a little dirty!
