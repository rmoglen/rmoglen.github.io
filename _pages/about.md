Hello, world! I am an energy systems modeler at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the Energy Systems and Climate Analysis (ESCA) group. My research focuses on long-term utility resource planning, decision-making under uncertainty, and optimization.

I completed my Ph.D. in [Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Program (ORIE)](https://www.orie.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My dissertation explored the interdependencies between infrastructure systems through the lens of disaster resilience. My advisor was [Prof. Benjamin Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/). I earned my M.S. in [mechanical engineering](https://enme.umd.edu/) from the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of [Prof. Steven Gabriel](http://www.stevenagabriel.umd.edu/).  My B.S. is in [civil engineering](https://cee.umd.edu/) with a focus on water resources, also from the University of Maryland, College Park.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/rachelmoglen), and creating [art](https://rmoglen.github.io/art/). 


**Research interests:** [macro-energy systems](https://www.macroenergysystems.org/); network modeling; infrastructure resilience; energy-water nexus; planning under uncertainty
