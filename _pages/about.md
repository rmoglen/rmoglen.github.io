Hello, world! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Program (ORIE)](https://www.orie.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My current work explores the interdependencies between infrastructure systems through the lens of disaster resilience. My advisor is [Prof. Benjamin Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/).

I earned my M.S. in [mechanical engineering](https://enme.umd.edu/) from the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of [Prof. Steven Gabriel](http://www.stevenagabriel.umd.edu/).  In collaboration with our corporate partner Whisker Labs (now [Resideo](https://www.resideo.com/us/en/)), we aimed to bring optimal demand-side management to the residential sector with the aid of IoT devices. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, climbing, and cooking.
