Dr. Rachel Moglen is an energy systems modeler in the [Energy Systems and Climate Analysis Group](https://esca.epri.com/index.html) at [EPRI](https://www.epri.com/). She is a research scientist in Program 178 on Resource Planning for Electric Power Systems. Her research at EPRI focuses on long-term integrated resource planning, stochastic modeling, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Prior to joining EPRI, Dr. Moglen completed her Ph.D. in [Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Program (ORIE)](https://www.orie.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin, working with [Prof. Benjamin Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/). Her dissertation applied optimization frameworks to large-scale real-world infrastructure systems, including power, water, and wireless communications, to derive practical insights supporting infrastructure resilience. Dr. Moglen holds an M.S. in [mechanical engineering](https://enme.umd.edu/) and a B.S. in [civil engineering](https://cee.umd.edu/), both from the University of Maryland, College Park.

In her free time, Rachel enjoys climbing, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/rachelmoglen), and creating [art](https://rmoglen.github.io/art/). 


**Research interests:** long-term resource planning; [macro-energy systems](https://www.macroenergysystems.org/); network modeling; infrastructure resilience; energy-water nexus; planning under uncertainty
